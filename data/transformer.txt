Transformers in Electrical Substations

Overview

Transformers are one of the most critical components in electrical substations. Their primary function is to transfer electrical energy between circuits through electromagnetic induction, allowing voltage to be stepped up for transmission or stepped down for distribution. They ensure efficient power delivery across long distances while minimizing losses.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Working Principle of a  Transformer

A transformer is a static electromagnetic device that transfers electrical energy between two or more circuits through electromagnetic induction. It enables the transmission and distribution of electrical power at varying voltage levels, minimizing losses and ensuring efficient energy flow across the substation network.

Transformers in substations primarily function as step-up or step-down devices:

Step-up transformers increase generator output voltage for long-distance transmission (e.g., 11 kV → 220 kV).

Step-down transformers reduce high transmission voltages to safer distribution levels (e.g., 220 kV → 33 kV → 11 kV → 415 V).

Principle of Electromagnetic Induction

The transformer operates on Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction, which states that any change in the magnetic flux linking a coil induces an electromotive force (EMF) in it.
Mathematically:
E=−NdtdΦ​
	​
where,

E = Induced EMF (Volts)

N = Number of turns in the winding

Φ = Magnetic flux (Weber)

When alternating current (AC) flows through the primary winding, it generates an alternating magnetic flux in the laminated steel core. This flux links both primary and secondary windings and induces a voltage in the secondary winding due to mutual induction.

Voltage and Current Relationship

The voltage transformation ratio is directly proportional to the turns ratio:

V2/​V1​​=N2/​N1​​
where,

V₁, V₂ = Primary and secondary voltages

N₁, N₂ = Number of turns in primary and secondary windings

The corresponding current relationship is inversely proportional:
I2​/I1​​=​N2/N1​​

This ensures power balance (neglecting losses):
V1​I1​=V2​I2​

Thus, while voltage changes according to the winding ratio, the overall power remains nearly constant.


Magnetic Core and Flux Path

The core serves as the magnetic circuit that provides a low-reluctance path for the flux. It is typically made of cold-rolled grain-oriented (CRGO) steel laminations, insulated from each other to minimize eddy current losses.

Core Type Transformers: Windings are placed on two limbs of the core.

Shell Type Transformers: Both windings are wound on the central limb with flux returning through outer limbs.

Flux leakage is minimized by using tight magnetic coupling between primary and secondary coils.


Losses and Efficiency

Two major losses affect performance:

Core (Iron) Losses:

Hysteresis Loss: Due to magnetization and demagnetization of the core during each cycle.

Eddy Current Loss: Induced circulating currents within the laminations.
Reduced using CRGO steel and thin laminations.

Copper Losses:

Caused by I²R losses in the windings.

Managed through optimal conductor sizing and temperature monitoring.

Overall efficiency (η) is expressed as:

η=(Output Power / Output Power + Losses) x 100

Typical efficiency for power transformers ranges from 98%–99.7%.


Cooling and Temperature Regulation

Since losses convert into heat, temperature rise must be controlled for reliable operation. Transformers employ several cooling techniques:

ONAN (Oil Natural Air Natural): For distribution transformers.

ONAF (Oil Natural Air Forced): Fans increase air circulation.

OFAF (Oil Forced Air Forced): Pumps circulate oil actively.

OFWF (Oil Forced Water Forced): For high-capacity transformers.

Cooling ensures the winding temperature remains below 105°C (Class A insulation limit).

 Protection and Monitoring Systems

Transformers are equipped with protective and diagnostic devices:

Buchholz Relay: Detects gas accumulation from internal arcing.

Pressure Relief Device (PRD): Prevents tank rupture.

Oil Temperature Indicator (OTI) and Winding Temperature Indicator (WTI): Monitor thermal conditions.

Silica Gel Breather: Maintains dry air in conservator tanks.

Differential and Overcurrent Relays: Detect fault currents.

These systems are integrated into Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems for real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance.

Transformer Testing Procedures

Testing ensures the operational reliability, dielectric strength, and mechanical integrity of transformers. These tests are divided into routine, type, and special tests as per IEC 60076 and IEEE C57.12.90 standards.

 Insulation Resistance (IR) Test

Purpose: To assess the health of insulation between windings and between windings and the core.

Method: A 5 kV Megger is used to apply DC voltage across the windings.

Typical Values:

Transformer Failure Modes and Corrective Actions

Transformers, though designed for high reliability and long operational life, are susceptible to various failure modes due to electrical, thermal, and mechanical stresses. One of the most common causes of failure is insulation degradation, which occurs over time because of excessive heating, moisture ingress, or contamination of the insulating oil. This deterioration leads to reduced dielectric strength and eventual insulation breakdown between windings or core laminations. Overloading and hot spots within windings accelerate this process, potentially resulting in short circuits or inter-turn faults. Another major issue arises from winding deformation, which can occur due to mechanical stresses during short-circuit events or vibrations, leading to displacement and eventual failure.

Oil contamination and leakage are also critical concerns; transformer oil serves both as an insulator and coolant, and the presence of moisture, dissolved gases, or oxidation products can severely compromise its performance. Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) is often employed as a diagnostic tool to detect early-stage failures such as arcing, overheating, or partial discharge by analyzing the types and concentrations of gases dissolved in the oil. In addition, bushing failures and tap changer malfunctions can lead to catastrophic breakdowns if not addressed promptly. Bushings, being the interface between the transformer windings and external circuits, are prone to surface tracking, moisture absorption, and cracking, while on-load tap changers (OLTCs) are subject to contact wear, carbonization, and mechanical fatigue due to frequent switching operations.

Cooling system failures also pose a serious threat, as blocked oil passages, fan or pump malfunctions, or inadequate cooling can lead to abnormal temperature rise, accelerating insulation aging and increasing internal pressure. Similarly, core faults, such as localized heating due to lamination shorting or poor grounding, contribute to efficiency loss and eventual equipment damage. External factors such as lightning surges, switching transients, and improper earthing can also cause dielectric failures or flashovers, especially in high-voltage substations.

To mitigate these failures, preventive and predictive maintenance strategies are implemented. Regular monitoring of temperature, oil quality, and load conditions helps detect abnormalities early. Corrective actions include oil filtration or replacement, tightening of electrical connections, drying of insulation systems, and rewinding or core repair when necessary. For mechanical issues, vibration analysis and frequency response analysis (FRA) are conducted to detect displacement or structural deformation. In the case of major internal faults, the transformer is taken offline for detailed inspection, repair, or replacement.

Adopting condition-based monitoring systems integrated with IoT and AI analytics further enhances reliability by predicting potential failures before they occur. This proactive approach, combined with adherence to international standards such as IEC 60076 and IEEE C57.104, ensures safe, efficient, and prolonged operation of transformers within substations, thereby minimizing downtime and maintaining grid stability.
